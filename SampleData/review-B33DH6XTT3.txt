We were early Echo adopters, back when you had to get an invitation to buy one. When that one conked out, I thought I'd give this a try. The screen looks great. Sounds reasonably good, although I would never listen to music on this for any extended period of time. We keep ours in the kitchen. Will be installing a home security system, the Arlo Pro 2, this weekend and am looking forward to tying the Echo Show into the system so I can see who's ringing the door bell. Will probably get one for my Mom for Christmas so we can more easily video chat.
