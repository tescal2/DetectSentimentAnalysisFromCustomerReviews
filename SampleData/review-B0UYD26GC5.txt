the product you sent was defective. End of story. A total different product which is worth less to us was sent as a replacement. We are now completely frustrated and cannot believe that we have to go through the process of shipping back the cheap iteam you orginally sent adn then request a full refund. Oh yeah, and this is all while documenting everything and wasting cycles when I can be out enjoying my life. Thanks for nothing!
